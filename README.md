# Machine Learning Project/ learning practice Repository

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Project Repository**! This repository is a collection of projects and my learning practice,demonstrating various machine learning concepts, models, and applications. It serves as both a learning portfolio and a showcase of practical implementations.

## Overview
The repository contains end-to-end machine learning projects, from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis to model building, evaluation, and deployment. Each project is designed to focus on specific challenges and solutions in machine learning.

### Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, feature scaling, and feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and understanding datasets.
- **Model Development**: Implementation of regression, classification, and clustering models.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Applying metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and RMSE.
- **Model Deployment**: Scripts for deploying models as APIs or web applications.

## Getting Started
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mlproject-repo.git
cd mlproject-repo
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running Scripts
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Navigate to the `src` folder and run:
     ```bash
     python preprocess.py
     ```

2. **Training Models**:
   - Run the training script to build models:
     ```bash
     python train.py
     ```

3. **Deploying Models**:
   - Use the deployment script to create an API:
     ```bash
     python deploy.py
     ```

## Learning Highlights
1. **Data Handling**:
   - Cleaning and transforming raw data into machine-readable formats.
2. **Model Selection**:
   - Experimenting with various algorithms to identify the best fit.
3. **Evaluation and Optimization**:
   - Fine-tuning models to achieve optimal performance.
4. **Model Deployment**:
